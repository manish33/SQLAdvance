1)
SELECT * INTO CustomersBackup2017
FROM Customers;

2)
SELECT * INTO CustomersBackup2017 IN 'Backup.mdb'
FROM Customers;

3) SELECT CustomerName, ContactName INTO CustomersBackup2017
   FROM Customers;

4) SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
   INTO CustomersOrderBackup2017
   FROM Customers
   LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;

5) Tip: SELECT INTO can also be used to create a new, empty table using the schema of another.
 Just add a WHERE clause that causes the query to return no data:

 SELECT * INTO newtable
 FROM oldtable
 WHERE 1 = 0;
