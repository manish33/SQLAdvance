I want to use the second column (art_count) to show only those rows containing X percent of total art_count.

My data:

title   art_count
a       3
b       12
c       9
d       4
e       45


SELECT title, COUNT(art) AS art_count
FROM table1
GROUP BY title
HAVING art_count >= (select count(*) * X / 100 from table1)
