1)The following SQL statement lists the ProductName if ALL the records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity equal to 10.
 This will of course return FALSE because the Quantity column has many different values (not only the value of 10):


SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ALL
  (SELECT ProductID
  FROM OrderDetails
  WHERE Quantity = 10);


2) The following SQL statement lists the ProductName if it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity larger than 99
 (this will return TRUE because the Quantity column has some values larger than 99):



SELECT ProductName
   FROM Products
   WHERE ProductID = ANY
     (SELECT ProductID
     FROM OrderDetails
     WHERE Quantity > 99);
