DELETE is a DML(Data Manipulation Language) command and is used when we specify the row (tuple) that we want to remove or
delete from the table or relation. The DELETE command can contain a WHERE clause. If the WHERE clause is used with the DELETE command,
then it removes or deletes only those rows (tuples) that satisfy the condition;
otherwise, by default, it removes all the tuples (rows) from the table. Remember that DELETE logs the row deletions.


TRUNCATE is a DDL(Data Definition Language) command and is used to delete all the rows or tuples from a table. Unlike the DELETE command,
the TRUNCATE command does not contain a WHERE clause. In the TRUNCATE command, the transaction log for each deleted data page is not recorded.
Unlike the DELETE command, the TRUNCATE command is fast. We cannot roll back the data after using the TRUNCATE command.


To use Delete you need DELETE permission on the table.

To use Truncate on a table we need at least ALTER permission on the table.
