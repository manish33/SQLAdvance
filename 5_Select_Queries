SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;


Example

1) SELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customers;

2) SELECT * FROM Customers;

3) SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;

4) SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;

5) SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;

6) SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country='Mexico'

7) Finding duplicate pairs:
SELECT uid FROM tablename
GROUP BY uid, name HAVING COUNT(*) = 2;

8) SELECT * FROM Customers
   WHERE CustomerID > 80;

9) SELECT column1, column2, ...
   FROM table_name
   WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;

   SELECT *
   FROM Customers
   WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND CustomerName LIKE 'G%';

 10)
 SELECT * FROM Customers
 WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND (CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%');

 11)
 Without parenthesis, the select statement will return all customers from Spain that starts with a "G",
 plus all customers that starts with an "R", regardless of the country value:


 SELECT * FROM Customers
 WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%';

12) SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE NOT Country = 'Spain';

    SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE CustomerName NOT LIKE 'A%';

 SELECT * FROM Customers
 WHERE City NOT IN ('Paris', 'London');


13) SELECT column_names
    FROM table_name
    WHERE column_name IS NULL;

14) SELECT column_names
    FROM table_name
    WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;
