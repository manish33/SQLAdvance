Note: If some customers or suppliers have the same city, each city will only be listed once,
because UNION selects only distinct values. Use UNION ALL to also select duplicate values!


1)
SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;


2)The following SQL statement returns the cities (duplicate values also) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:

SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION ALL
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;

3)
SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
UNION
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany'
ORDER BY City;

4) The following SQL statement lists all customers and suppliers:

SELECT 'Customer' AS Type, ContactName, City, Country
FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT 'Supplier', ContactName, City, Country
FROM Suppliers;
