1) SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers

3)SELECT column_name(s)

  WHERE condition
  LIMIT number;

4) SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;

MYSQL: SELECT * FROM Customers
       ORDER BY your_ordering_column
       LIMIT (SELECT COUNT(*) * 0.5 FROM Customers);

In MySQL, the LIMIT clause can be used without an explicit ORDER BY clause,
 but the order of the results may not be predictable, as it depends on the physical storage and retrieval of the data.
 If you use LIMIT without ORDER BY, the database engine will return an arbitrary subset of rows.
